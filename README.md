# Reality Distortion Field 2.0 #

  The term *Reality Distortion Field* was used to describe the
  ability of Steve Jobs to get his engineers to buy into his vision
  and build machines just at the edge of what was possible with the
  technology at the time. We wouldn't be talking about Apple or Jobs
  or his Reality Distortion Field if not for his other talent, which
  was his uncanny ability to pick the right things to build: things
  that nobody imagined or expected, but had to have once seen.
  
  A prime example was the creation of the Apple II, which was so
  far beyond competitors, that it really formed a different category
  of product: A computer to use, as opposed to a computer to tinker
  with. The Apple II was lusted after by customers. Same thing with
  the iPod, when the competition was hard-to-use MP3 players. And then
  the iPhone, which redefined what a cellphone was, back when the
  competition sold nothing but portable *phones*. NeXT was the
  forerunner of modern Macs. And there were numerous smaller examples:
  Adding the 3.5" floppy drive, (and then deleting it).
  In each case, Steve and Apple were correct,
  and everyone else was wrong. That was Reality Distortion Field 1.0.

  But for a few years now, we have been experiencing a new and
  inferior kind of reality distortion field from Apple. In Reality
  Distortion Field 2.0, Apple's size, and their confidence in their
  ability to change reality is leading them badly astray.  They make
  decisions for a world that they want to exist, but absolutely cannot
  ever exist. Apple is a one trillion dollar company and Steve is
  gone. No wonder it can no longer perceive the world accurately.

## The iPhone case ##

  You need one. This is the ultimate example of Apple's Reality
  Distortion Field 2.0. Each new iPhone model is thinner than its
  predecessor, and wrapped in some new, stunning, futuristic
  material. The promotional media for these products always always
  always highlight the ever sleeker new exterior. But nobody gets to
  experience these perfect objects. They are so delicate that any
  misstep in handling them is likely to crack the screen, or the back
  surface, and possibly one of the few remaining mechanical controls on
  the side. Unless you are below, let's say, 30 inches in height, you
  need a case to protect your phone because you will inevitably drop it.

  Back in Reality Distortion Field 1.0 days, Apple would have come up
  with a design that is beautiful and functions in the real world.  It
  would have been crazy at first. A phone made out of wood? or rubber?
  or leather? or sand and epoxy? People would have blinked in disbelief,
  and mocked Apple for its stubborn idiocy.  And then in a few months,
  it would be the most obvious thing. A resilient phone that survives
  contact with hardwood floors, and concrete sidewalks &mdash; why doesn't
  Samsung do this?
  
  But RDF 2.0 says: We made this beautiful
  device. Forget about how you use it in the real world. Forget about
  gravity. If you were an astronaut in a padded space capsule, this
  would be the phone for you. Enjoy our stunning photographs of these
  devices (taken on an iPhone XR). Please buy this fragile, beautiful,
  futuristic thousand plus dollar miracle, and permanently seal it
  inside an ugly layer of blubber, whose coefficient of friction is so
  high that it only reluctantly leaves your pocket. But just know that
  the piece of art you bought is in there somewhere.
  
## The 3.5mm headphone jack ##

  SPOILER ALERT: In season 71 of The Man in the High Castle, there
    will be a version of 2016 USA in which bluetooth
    connectivity is universal and flawless. Steve, who is alive in
    this world, notices the state of bluetooth, and decides to remove
    the headphone jack from iPhones. Connecting to a bluetooth speaker
    is minimally intrusive. Your iPhone asks before connecting to each
    new bluetooth device encountered, but then remembers your choice,
    and just connects automatically, quickly, silently.

  What we have now is exactly like this season 71 world, except that
    Steve is gone, everyone still needs a headphone jack *and* a
    dongle, bluetooth connectivity is fragile and flaky, and people
    are placing their iPhones in (empty) coffee mugs to amplify the
    tiny iPhone speakers.

## USB-C ##

  The problems of USB-C have been widely discussed.
  The author of [this](https://marco.org/2017/10/14/impossible-dream-of-usb-c)
  note, Marco Arment, notes the RDF 2.0 nature of USB-C &mdash; great
  idea, but not in this world: "I love the idea of USB-C: one port and
  one cable that can replace all other ports and cables. It sounds so
  simple, straightforward, and unified.  In practice, it's not even
  close."

  Maybe it can be the best connector, one day. And maybe it already
  is, in a narrow, technical sense. But &mdash; the dongles. Who
  carries all that crap around? Why is it that if you buy the newest
  iPhone and the newest MacBook, you cannot just plug one into the
  other? Still? This one little piece of reality is something that
  Apple could easily change.

## iPhone WiFi controls ##

  After I inherited my wife's iPhone 7 Plus, I upgraded to iOS 11,
  and discovered the joys of the new, convenient, aspirational WiFi
  control. You swipe up, and get a control panel. There is a button
  with a WiFi logo, for toggling WiFi connectivity. When you disable
  WiFi, a message flashes: "Disconnecting Nearby Wi-Fi Until
  Tomorrow". But your WiFi isn't really disconnected. It is
  temporarily stunned, and soon will doggedly keep trying to
  reconnect, as soon as you move a few meters from your current
  location. WiFi hotspots that don't work, that require a password you
  don't know, that require you to visit a web page and watch an ad,
  that contain theoretically useful information, or that require you
  to click agreement to terms and conditions &mdash; your phone will
  try to connect to any and all of them, and eagerly ask you which of
  these useless hotspots you would like to fail to connect to. And
  during these pathetic attempts to be helpful, your connectivity is
  completely gone, because you have sensibly configured your phone to
  prefer WiFi to a cellular connection.  Eventually, you get so tired
  of these nuisances, that you go to the phone's full Settings panel
  and actually turn off WiFi for real.
  
  It should be the case that when you return to a familiar
  location, your phone will *finally* get it right, and silently connect
  to a hotspot that has worked for you in the past. And sometimes it
  does! But sometimes it doesn't! Who knows? So exciting to find out!
  
  RDF 2.0 requires Apple to pretend that WiFi
  connectivity is seamless. Maybe that's how it is at the Apple
  Spaceship HQ, the one with the glass walls that RDF 2.0 says must be
  spotless, even though employees keep
  trying to walk through them. But elsewhere,
  the world still has clunky WiFi, and the WiFi control panel design is
  useless and annoying.


## Laptop Keyboards ##

Here is what RDF 2.0 says about laptops: 1) Newer laptops must be
  thinner than older laptops; 2) Laptops are used exclusively in
  dust-free environments; and 3) Nobody eats anything composed of
  crumbs while operating a laptop. So-called *keyboard malfunctions*
  have been observed in extreme testing environments, in which dust
  and crumbs are present, but obviously those are highly unrealistic
  conditions.

Apple laptops used to have great keyboards. Easy to type on, but
  with some gentle and quiet tactile feedback. But then, presumably in
  pursuit of ever-thinner laptops, they redesigned their laptop
  keyboards to be fragile and unpleasant to type on. Also, they
  deleted about 16% of the keyboard, replacing the Function and Esc
  keys by the execrable touchbar. The touchbar is clearly the result
  of design-by-committee, as it isn't available on any non-laptop
  keyboard, even those made by Apple. It's as if there was one group
  that wanted them, another group realized that these things were the
  second coming of Clippy, and laptops-only was the compromise. Back
  in RDF 1.0 days, there would at least have been *one* view of
  reality.

## iCloud ##

  Apple imagines a world in which I can move seamlessly from one of
  my many Apple devices to another, and whatever item I want,
  regardless of where I created it or last used it, the latest version
  of this item is magically available on the device I am currently
  using. It's a beautiful idea. According to RDF 2.0, connectivity is
  perfect, and so fast that any digital asset I care about can be
  moved to my device in the 2 msec between the time I press a button,
  and my brain registers the haptic feedback, and tells my eyes and
  ears to expect the content to start playing.
  
  But in the real world, iCloud has decided to replace my rare Bob Dylan
  bootleg by the standard version from Blonde on Blonde. Or I want to
  listen to a podcast but it won't download right now. Or something has
  gone wrong again with my Apple ID, or the family sharing setup, and I
  can't access my stuff. Or I'm someplace with a bad signal and all my
  music is unavailable. Or the syncing options on my laptop were not set
  up quite right, so now I can't access the files I need until I go back
  to my hotel and change the settings on my laptop. Or I can't find the
  photos I took last week because, oh who the hell knows why?  It's just
  too complicated and fidgety.
  
  The rules defining the movement of files from a device to the
  cloud, and from the cloud to a device are just far too inscrutable for
  Apple's vision to work. Apple controls those rules, and could
  presumably do something about them. But that would mean fixing iTunes,
  which has just been getting more bloated and complicated from one
  release to the next. Similarly, the Apple ID and cloud configuration
  choices are just bewildering. Remember when you could pick up an Apple
  device you had never seen before and you just knew how it would work,
  and it did? Yeah, no, that was back in RDF 1.0 days. 

  Now, during RDF 2.0, Apple is approaching Microsoft
  territory. That place where touching your computer causes feelings
  of dread to rise up, because some things don't work the way they
  should, and you are helpless. You could ask Apple for support, but
  it will take your entire afternoon to go through the support script
  with the friendly support person. Having done that, your support
  person gets a point for his productivity (went through the entire
  script with a customer!) but your problem isn't fixed. You learn to
  live with the problem. It's the place that Bill Gates, the founder
  of Microsoft,
  [realized](https://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2008/06/24/full-text-an-epic-bill-gates-e-mail-rant)
  that his company was in. But Steve is gone, so he can't realize
  it. Tim Cook cares about nothing but the bottom line and the supply
  chain.

  Suppose that Apple miraculously clears away all the iCloud
  clutter. There is one panel, "Sharing", let's say, that has five
  checkboxes that allow you to configure everything having to do with
  sharing of information across devices and within your family. This
  seamless sharing model is impossible for two reasons.
  
  First, there is DRM. Too many distributors of "content" really love
  the model in which you don't "own" things, like music or movies; you
  merely have the right to play them in proscribed
  ways. This isn't Apple's fault. But until it changes, sharing is
  not seamless, and their cloud model can't really work.
  
  Second, there is the fact that connectivity is still not as good as
  would be needed for the model to work. If I'm driving in a tunnel, or
  flying, or in remote places, or in places without good cell coverage,
  or my phone is trying WiFi again (see above), or, or, or, ... then the
  model is, again, unworkable.
  
  Apple's approach to the cloud is wrong. It just works except for the
  zillions of ways and times in which it doesn't. And the attempts to
  hide and work around those failures create a mess.  RDF 2.0 says that
  these petty concerns will be resolved eventually, just be patient.
  
  Apple should not design iCloud to pretend that these business and
  technical limitations don't exist. They have it exactly backward &mdash;
  these limitations should constrain design. Listen, Apple. I have some
  stuff on my laptop. I want some of it on my phone. Don't pretend it's
  just there, and then leave me puzzled and frustrated when it
  isn't. Let me say "copy this stuff to my phone". And then if that
  isn't possible, tell me why. I'll understand, really. If you want to
  use your cloud as a cache to make that movement of stuff faster &mdash;
  great. But it's a cloud. I don't want to constantly be checking the
  sky for signs of thunderstorms. It should mostly just be something I
  ignore.


## Conclusion ##

  The RDF 1.0 approach to design was the old classic: *form follows
  function*.  In RDF 2.0 it has become *form follows fetish*. Function is
  disconnected from reality.
  
  Apple, it's over between us. It's not me, it's you.
